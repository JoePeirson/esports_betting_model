### Introduction
At the start of March 2020, most of the football leagues in Europe stopped due to COVID. Because of this there were less football matches being traded on betting websites. Therefore, many betting websites started to offer odds of epsports FIFA matches. These matches were 8 minutes long and played between what seems like professional fifa players who all play under their own username.

When these matches started it seemed like the odds given for a draw were far too generous. But like all good data scientist I wanted to carry out robust analysis on this before betting on these.

### Data Collection
The data I wanted to collect was match results and the prematch odds offered. 

### Data Analysis
My Analysis showed very profitable results. When looking at just the last 50 matches between two opponents, if there is a number of draws which have implied odds that are higher than the bookmakers odds, then this is a profitable bet. To add to this, the bigger discrepency between the projected odds and then bookmakers odds leads to a higher return on investment (roi). This is shown below in the first image. The second image shows the high correlation between my projected ROI, and the actual ROI. For example, when I only place bets where I believe I will have a 20% ROI, then the actual ROI will be around 20%.
